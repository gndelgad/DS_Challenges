# Watershed challenge.

The objective of this challenge is to answer to the following questions for the watersheds in Chile:

* Has the frequency of heat waves events increased over the last years?
* Is there any relationship between heat waves and peak flow events?
* If so, can we correlate those events with the watershed's features?
